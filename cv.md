### Summary
I'm very passionate about learning JavaScript! (and Front-End in general).
Nowadays people are dealing with Javascript almost every day while surfing on the Internet. Javascript improves user experience and makes websites much prettier.

Regarding my personal aim, I'm sure that everyone should learn all life long. So I think that the skill to learn constantly is one of the most important skills. And I hope I have that skill. Anyway, I have the desire to learn and improve myself via challenging tasks.

So I'm here in [RS School](https://rs.school/) to get so much experience I can get. And possibly to use this great experience in the future.
